___
#### The Bad People list is created and managed by Kyuzto to bring awareness of users you should avoid at all costs
___

##### » Disclearing/Gr0unded/Apifile/Dripdon1/Brexit/brexitisexit
##### Apifile is on just about every "Skid-list" on github he is no expectation here either he is well-known in this community for his misdeeds and actions towards users regardless of what he claims he will never change nor do anything that is worth attention. he has also griefed servers such as GTMinecart and small servers, he will honestly join a new hcf server as a developer and then wait for their release and then leak their files and user's IPS 2 days later so it hurts the server's rep and causes them to quit. he also rooms blackspigot in order to gain a following from that shitty site's community full of ratters.
##### All and all do not trust Apifile with any kind of access to your server or any communication with him he backdoors anything he provides and can't even use eclipse properly half the time.

##### » BabyClew/Clew/Simpsons/Xo Mericals/Shiroshu/improvisors/Mr. Zilex Client(Credit to C0an for the name)

##### BabyClew better known as "Clew" has the same reputation as Disclearing if not worse, there is countless evidence that proves this user only cares for his network (Zilex Network) and money. if you even attempt to create a video on this user you can guarantee when you check your email the next day or so you'll have a strike and the the video will be removed or all profits will go clew. below is screenshots of some of his interesting threats.

##### » BabyAvaah/Avaah/depressedava

##### Ava is someone who isn't a "skidder" rather someone who has in DevCole's words "a hungry little motherfucker jumping from boy to boy every 2 weeks" "Avaah" is been exposed as being a male pretending to be a female (There is nothing wrong with being transgender) however in ava's case "He" was using his "Persona" of being a female to lore boys in to use them for power in the case of Warfine I personally warned FigT at the time "She" was using him for Owner and Power but at the time FigT was blinded by love and I understand the feeling no hate to him. he quickly pushed ava to the curb once he found out ava was a dude.

##### Avaah at the time of creating his list is still a Moderator on PvP Land, I ask that you all go and report this information to the managers as someone who is like this doesn't deserve any rank on any server in this community and should just quit minecraft and do something with their lives.

##### » ZeflyYT/Zefly/EliteSmooth/Misthought

##### Zefly is someone who claims to be the best developer but can only use leaked code that can be found either on blackspigot or provided to him by a third party, Zefly has "Created" a few "Custom"(iHCF leaked code) cores and has scammed people out of money and time. he created TazeHQ a server that ended up becoming an IP Farm and caused for a lot of user's IPs being leaked. he has leaked broken cores onto his channel to get a following from 13 year olds that can't simply buy a core from mc-market that actually works. 

##### His "Core Leaks" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEWRVppzMHo
##### There we more but he took down all of his videos on his main channel that video is what remains

##### » ItzAssassin/Ethan

##### ItzAssassin has a history of "using" people and ignoring people who made him famous, ItzAssassin was an Owner of HCStatic and has scummed a lot of people, DeleteKey provided me with this statement.

##### "He basically sold his server hcstatic to tank tracks and other people who I forgot and basically people bought rank but the server never came out or had a beta. Then itzassassin rebought it or whatever and made people rebuy ranks even if they had them on the hcstatic sold to tank tracks. And idk if anyone bought ranks but 2 months after the fact seemed like he only cared about hcrival and didn't give a shit about the people on hcstatic and the people who bought ranks Also not to mention he has owned servers will with Zefly in the past so wouldn't be surprised if he used skidded plugins" - DeleteKey#1342

##### Regardless of that, ItzAssassin has been recently exposed for "skidding" Nova Client (A PvP Based Client created by PlumpOrange) and claiming it to be "HCRival Client" once this spread ItzAssassin had gone into "Damage Control" by explaining the situation and then removing the client from public eye and then for a brief time shouting out Nova, everything was good then until he removed the discord link and just now ignores the situation.

##### TwitLonger Post regarding the HCStatic Case https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1squ2qg
##### NovaClient Drama https://twitter.com/Nova_Client/status/1155917743239180288

##### All and all ItzAssassin's following is just Botted users or just blind people that believe every word he states. utterly a blind fool.
